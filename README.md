# a lil library app
some practice with object constructors

## What I did (WIP)
1. Built the UI for a small interactive web app

## What I learned (WIP)
1. I can't always get everything as perfect as I see them in my mind. But it does have to be good enough.
2. Clear commits are really nice. I'm using the log to track where I'm at with this project. Super helpful!

I should have wrote some reflections from yesterday. But I can sum it up now before moving on:
- It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

haha, I'm 10000% joking. But ti did take me too long to build the UI. I probably invested too much time into it. But also, I like things to look decent? Is that so bad? Also also, the script that powers this little app depends on the UI being a certain way. I need to have my elements in place before I can start messing with the DOM.

No regrets. Just glad for the opportunity. At least I'm getting faster!

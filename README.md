# a lil library app
some practice with object constructors

## What I did (WIP)
1. Built the UI for a small interactive web app

## What I learned (WIP)
1. I can't always get everything as perfect as I see them in my mind. But it does have to be good enough.
2. Clear commits are really nice. I'm using the log to track where I'm at with this project. Super helpful!
3. It's a really really good idea to make sure you have your files linked correctly before spending an hour trying to figure out why things aren't working...
4. The X and Y problem showed up clearly. Caught myself before going too far.
5. I physically felt myself figure something out. It was like a chill ran through me that was connected to the "correct" path in the code. So I typed, not even fully knowing why I was doing what I was doing. Sort of like typing english like this in the way that I don't really have to plot out all my moves, I can just type and how I can get to the end of the sentence in one piece. That sentence was very long and not a good example :D

I should have wrote some reflections from yesterday. But I can sum it up now before moving on:
- It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

haha, I'm 10000% joking. But ti did take me too long to build the UI. I probably invested too much time into it. But also, I like things to look decent? Is that so bad? Also also, the script that powers this little app depends on the UI being a certain way. I need to have my elements in place before I can start messing with the DOM.

No regrets. Just glad for the opportunity. At least I'm getting faster!

I think I've missed the point.

I haven't really been using the array. I've just been using it in a superficial way to store stuff, not to dynamically create UI elements from it. 

*even later that same day @10:12pm*

I thought I should give up. My mind was so knotted up. So I laid on the hard floor and pressed my palms to my eyes. I wrapped my ears in sythwave and just rested. Sipped some tea. Rested more. I blamed others, I blamed myself, and then I started to laugh, I started to smile, I picked up a book "To Be Taught, If Fortunate" by Becky Chambers. Much recommend.

I decided to create a new branch focused on simplicity. I realized that this isn't going to be the last time that I feel crammed for time and don't know enough to go on. But I'm still going to have to go on. There are worse things, for sure. And what's better, giving up now? Or figuring out a way to move through this difficult and unknown situation? I'd be much more proud of myself for the latter. That is, I want to be the person who can stick with difficult things and learn from them. Not the person who runs away.

So far, it's really good. I know that I "wasted" a lot of time. But it's not a waste if I use what I learned to move smoother through this iteration.
